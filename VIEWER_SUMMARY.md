# Markdown Documentation Viewer - Summary

## What We've Built

I've created a comprehensive HTML-based markdown documentation viewer for your Collaborative Puzzle Platform project. The solution includes both a static HTML version and a server-based version with dynamic file loading.

## Files Created

### Core Files
1. **markdown-viewer.html** - Static HTML viewer with embedded file structure
2. **markdown-viewer-server.html** - Enhanced viewer that works with the Node.js server
3. **markdown-server.js** - Express server that provides API endpoints for file access
4. **package.json** - Node.js dependencies configuration
5. **start-viewer.bat** - Windows batch file to easily start the server

### Documentation Files (viewer-docs/)
1. **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Detailed requirements for the viewer
2. **README.md** - User guide and setup instructions
3. **TODO.md** - Development tasks organized by priority
4. **FUTURE.md** - Vision for future enhancements

## Key Features

### User Interface
- **Tree Navigation**: Hierarchical file structure with collapsible folders
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering of files by name
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code rendering with Highlight.js
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern interface using Tailwind CSS

### Technical Features
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full markdown support with Marked.js
- **File Caching**: Previously loaded files are cached for fast access
- **Dynamic Loading**: Server version automatically discovers markdown files
- **Security**: Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for file listing and content retrieval

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Server Version - Recommended)
1. Open a command prompt in the `D:\dev2\puzzletutorial\` directory
2. Run `start-viewer.bat` or `npm start`
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Navigate through your documentation files

### Static Version
1. Open `markdown-viewer.html` directly in your browser
2. Note: This version has a hardcoded file structure and placeholder content

## Architecture
