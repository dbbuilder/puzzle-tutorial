The viewer will:
1. Auto-discover all markdown files from the GitHub repository
2. Display them in an organized navigation structure
3. Include embedded learning resources, implementation checklist, and bibliography

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## How It Works

The viewer uses GitHub's API to discover markdown files and displays them with:
