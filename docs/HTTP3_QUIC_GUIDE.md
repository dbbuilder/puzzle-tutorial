# HTTP/3 and QUIC Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the HTTP/3 and QUIC protocol implementation in the Collaborative Puzzle Platform, demonstrating next-generation web protocols that provide improved performance and reliability.

## What is HTTP/3?

HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, built on top of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP:

- **Transport**: Uses QUIC (UDP-based) instead of TCP
- **Multiplexing**: True stream multiplexing without head-of-line blocking
- **0-RTT**: Zero round-trip connection establishment
- **Migration**: Connection migration across networks
- **Built-in Encryption**: TLS 1.3 is mandatory

## Implementation

### Server Configuration

```csharp
// Extensions/Http3Extensions.cs
public static WebApplicationBuilder ConfigureHttp3(this WebApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel((context, options) =>
    {
        // Enable HTTP/3
        options.ListenAnyIP(5001, listenOptions =>
        {
            listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3;
            listenOptions.UseHttps();
        });
    });
}
```

### Alt-Svc Header

The Alt-Svc (Alternative Services) header advertises HTTP/3 support:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    if (context.Request.IsHttps)
    {
        context.Response.Headers.Append("Alt-Svc", "h3=\":443\"; ma=86400");
    }
    await next();
});
```

### API Endpoints

The implementation includes several endpoints to demonstrate HTTP/3 features:

1. **Connection Info** - `/api/http3/info`
   - Shows current protocol version
   - Displays connection details
   - Verifies HTTP/3 features

2. **Performance Test** - `/api/http3/performance-test`
   - Measures download speeds
   - Compares with HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1
   - Tests various payload sizes

3. **Multiplexing Test** - `/api/http3/multiplexing-test`
   - Demonstrates parallel stream handling
   - Shows improved concurrency
   - No head-of-line blocking

4. **Stream Echo** - `/api/http3/echo-stream`
   - Tests bidirectional streaming
   - Upload/download performance
   - Data integrity verification

## Testing HTTP/3

### Browser Support

Ensure your browser supports HTTP/3:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Version 79+ (enable via chrome://flags)
- **Firefox**: Version 88+ (enable in about:config)
- **Safari**: Version 14+ (experimental)

### Using the Test Page

1. Access the test page at `https://localhost:5001/http3-test.html`
2. Click "Get Connection Info" to verify HTTP/3 connection
3. Run performance tests with different data sizes
4. Test multiplexing with parallel requests
5. Compare protocols for performance differences

### Command Line Testing

Using curl with HTTP/3 support:
```bash
# Requires curl built with HTTP/3 support
curl --http3 https://localhost:5001/api/http3/info

# Force HTTP/3
curl --http3-only https://localhost:5001/api/http3/info
```

## Performance Benefits

### 1. Reduced Latency
- 0-RTT connection establishment
- No TCP handshake overhead
- Faster initial page loads

### 2. Improved Multiplexing
- Independent streams
- No head-of-line blocking
- Better performance on lossy networks

### 3. Connection Migration
- Survives network changes
- Mobile-friendly
- Maintains connection across IP changes

## Configuration Options

### Kestrel Settings

```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "EndpointDefaults": {
      "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3"
    },
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
        "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP/3 Specific Limits

```csharp
options.Limits.Http3.MaxRequestHeaderFieldSize = 16384;
options.Limits.Http3.HeaderTableSize = 4096;
options.Limits.Http3.MaxRequestStreams = 100;
```

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Certificate Requirements
- Valid TLS certificate required
- TLS 1.3 support mandatory
- ALPN negotiation for protocol selection

### 2. Firewall Configuration
- UDP port 443 must be open
- Same port as HTTPS for easy deployment
- May require firewall rule updates

### 3. Load Balancer Support
- Requires QUIC-aware load balancers
- Session affinity considerations
- UDP load balancing capabilities

### 4. Monitoring
- New metrics for QUIC connections
- Packet loss monitoring
- Migration event tracking

## Production Deployment

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
# Expose UDP port for QUIC
EXPOSE 443/udp
EXPOSE 443/tcp

# Enable HTTP/3 in container
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+:443"
ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
ENV ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Protocols="Http1AndHttp2AndHttp3"
```

### Kubernetes Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: puzzle-api-http3
spec:
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
  - name: quic
    port: 443
    targetPort: 443
    protocol: UDP
```

### Nginx Configuration (if used as reverse proxy)

Note: Nginx doesn't yet support HTTP/3 proxying. Use direct exposure or HTTP/3-capable proxies like Cloudflare.

## Performance Metrics

Monitor these metrics for HTTP/3:
- Connection establishment time
- Stream creation rate
- Packet loss and retransmission
- Protocol negotiation success rate
- 0-RTT resumption rate

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Falls Back to HTTP/2
1. Check UDP port 443 is accessible
2. Verify Alt-Svc header is present
3. Ensure browser has HTTP/3 enabled
4. Check for middleboxes blocking QUIC

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor packet loss rates
2. Check MTU settings (QUIC prefers 1350 bytes)
3. Verify QUIC congestion control
4. Enable BBR congestion control if available

### Debugging Tools
- Chrome DevTools Protocol tab
- Wireshark with QUIC dissector
- `netstat -u` for UDP connections
- Application logs for protocol negotiation

## Best Practices

1. **Graceful Fallback**
   - Always support HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1
   - Implement proper protocol negotiation
   - Monitor fallback rates

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use 0-RTT for repeat connections
   - Implement proper caching headers
   - Optimize initial congestion window

3. **Security**
   - Keep TLS libraries updated
   - Monitor for protocol downgrade attacks
   - Implement proper rate limiting

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track protocol usage statistics
   - Monitor performance improvements
   - Set up alerts for high fallback rates
