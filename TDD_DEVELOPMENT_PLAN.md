# Test-Driven Development Plan

## Branch: feature/tdd-autonomous-development

This document outlines the TDD-focused autonomous development approach for completing the remaining features of the Collaborative Puzzle Platform.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

1. **Test First**: Write failing tests before any implementation
2. **Small Iterations**: Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards with analyzers and linting
5. **Documentation**: Update docs alongside code changes

## 📋 Priority Order

Based on TODO.md analysis, here's the development priority:

### Phase 1: Core Testing Infrastructure (High Priority)

- [ ] E2E test harness for SignalR
- [ ] Performance testing framework
- [ ] Load testing scenarios

### Phase 2: Authentication & Security (High Priority)
- [ ] JWT authentication implementation
- [ ] Azure AD B2C integration
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] OAuth2 flow

### Phase 3: Minimal APIs (High Priority)
- [ ] Convert endpoints to Minimal API style
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] API versioning
- [ ] Rate limiting with Redis

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Deployment (High Priority)
- [ ] Deployment manifests
- [ ] Service definitions
- [ ] Ingress configuration
- [ ] Horizontal pod autoscaling
- [ ] ConfigMaps and Secrets

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Structured logging with Serilog
- [ ] Application Insights integration
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Health check dashboard

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Response caching
- [ ] Output caching
- [ ] Memory cache implementation
- [ ] CDN integration
- [ ] Database query optimization

### Phase 7: QUIC/HTTP3 (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Kestrel HTTP/3 configuration
- [ ] QUIC transport implementation
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Browser support documentation

## 🧪 TDD Process for Each Feature

### 1. Planning Phase
- Review requirements
- Design API contracts
- Define acceptance criteria
- Create test scenarios

### 2. Red Phase (Failing Tests)
```csharp
// Example: JWT Authentication Tests
[Fact]
public async Task Authenticate_WithValidCredentials_ReturnsJwtToken()
{
    // Arrange
    var credentials = new LoginRequest 
    { 
        Username = "testuser", 
        Password = "password123" 
    };
    
    // Act
    var response = await _client.PostAsJsonAsync("/api/auth/login", credentials);
    var token = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<TokenResponse>();
    
    // Assert
    response.Should().BeSuccessful();
    token.Should().NotBeNull();
    token.AccessToken.Should().NotBeNullOrEmpty();
    token.ExpiresIn.Should().BeGreaterThan(0);
}
```

### 3. Green Phase (Implementation)
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- Focus on functionality, not optimization
- Keep it simple

### 4. Refactor Phase
- Improve code structure
- Extract common patterns
- Enhance readability
- Ensure tests still pass

## 🔧 Testing Tools

### Unit Testing
- xUnit (already in use)
- Moq for mocking
- FluentAssertions for readable assertions
- AutoFixture for test data

### Integration Testing
- TestServer for API testing
- Testcontainers for dependencies
- Respawn for database cleanup

### E2E Testing
- Playwright for browser automation
- SignalR test client
- WebSocket test client

### Performance Testing
- NBomber for load testing
- BenchmarkDotNet for micro-benchmarks
- K6 for API stress testing

## 📊 Code Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration Tests: 80%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Overall: 85%+ coverage

## 🚀 Continuous Integration

Each commit should:
1. Pass all existing tests
2. Include new tests for new features
3. Maintain or improve code coverage
4. Pass all code quality checks
5. Update relevant documentation

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

For each feature:
1. API documentation (OpenAPI)
2. Integration guide
3. Test examples
4. Performance characteristics
5. Security considerations

## 🔄 Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start from feature branch
git checkout feature/tdd-autonomous-development
git pull origin feature/tdd-autonomous-development

# 2. Create feature sub-branch
git checkout -b feature/jwt-authentication

# 3. Write tests first
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~JwtAuthentication"

# 4. Implement feature
# ... code ...

# 5. Run all tests
dotnet test

# 6. Check code coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover

# 7. Run quality checks
dotnet format
dotnet build /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true

# 8. Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT authentication with tests"

# 9. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/jwt-authentication
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Each feature is complete when:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets targets
- [ ] No code quality warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Security review complete
- [ ] PR approved and merged

## 📅 Estimated Timeline
