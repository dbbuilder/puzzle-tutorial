## Collaborative Jigsaw Puzzle Platform

### Project Overview
A real-time collaborative jigsaw puzzle platform that enables multiple users to simultaneously work on digital puzzles with live synchronization, voice chat capabilities, and persistent state management. The platform demonstrates modern web technologies including WebSockets, SignalR, WebRTC, Redis caching, containerization, and Kubernetes orchestration.

   - Automatic puzzle piece generation with configurable piece counts (100, 500, 1000, 2000 pieces)
   - Puzzle piece shape variation (standard jigsaw interlocking patterns)
   - Puzzle metadata storage (title, description, difficulty level, completion time estimates)

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**
   - Multiple users (2-20) working on same puzzle simultaneously
   - Real-time piece movement synchronization across all connected clients
   - Live user cursor tracking with username display
   - Piece locking mechanism to prevent conflicts during placement attempts
   - Visual indicators for pieces being moved by other users

3. **User Interaction**
   - Drag and drop puzzle piece placement
   - Piece rotation functionality (90-degree increments)
   - Zoom and pan capabilities for large puzzles
   - Snap-to-grid assistance for piece placement
   - Visual feedback for correct piece placement
   - Progress tracking and completion percentage display

4. **Communication Features**
   - Integrated text chat with message history
   - WebRTC-based voice chat between collaborators
   - User presence indicators (online, away, working on specific puzzle areas)
   - Collaborative pointer system for indicating puzzle areas

5. **Session Management**
   - Persistent puzzle state across user sessions
   - Ability to save and resume puzzle progress
   - Session invitation system via shareable links
   - User authentication and puzzle ownership
   - Guest user participation capabilities

#### Technical Requirements

1. **Performance Standards**
   - Sub-100ms latency for piece movement updates
   - Support for 20 concurrent users per puzzle session
   - Puzzle loading time under 5 seconds for 1000-piece puzzles
   - 99.9% uptime availability target

2. **Scalability Requirements**
   - Horizontal scaling capability for multiple puzzle sessions
   - Auto-scaling based on active user count
   - Geographic distribution support for global users
   - Database connection pooling and optimization

3. **Security Requirements**
   - Secure WebSocket connections (WSS protocol)
   - User authentication via Azure Active Directory B2C
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints and WebSocket connections
   - Input validation and sanitization for all user data
   - Secure file upload with virus scanning integration
